In college I used to make tick marks on a wall to count sirens I heard. Lots of people like to count things: [interesting reading in Bioscience](http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/66/12/1013.full)

Scientists have recently estimated that there are more than 3 trillion trees on earth -- that's 422 trees per person. That seems like a lot of trees. It is amazing that such an estimate is even possible. Apparently with remote sensing it is becoming even more possible to narrow down the [identity of all those trees](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07038992.2016.1207484).  And, with estimates of wood density, it becomes possible to project the carbon storage potential of forests, and different kinds of forests.

I met a young student at La Selva last month who said that she's finding that the wood densities reported in major databases are wrong. I forget if they were over- or underestimates, and it will be her story to tell anyway. But it may make a big difference when we attempt to make those large scale calculations about carbon storage.<hr>
