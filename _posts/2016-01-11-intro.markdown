description: just some background on why i’m doing this
---
I’m not the first person in my family to have discovered Jekyll (at least by that name) but I am the first to have a GitHub. I’m an annoying mother nagging a son to prepare to apply for jobs, and I am also a “lead by example” sort of person. So here we are. Not to mention that somewhere along the way my old website disappeared when I wasn’t looking so I have to start from scratch.

#### To do list
<ul>
	<li>Make a to do list</li>
	<li>Grab a previously created Jekyll theme</li>
	<li>Change the title, font color, etc.</li>
	<li>Change “poetry” to “creatives”</li>
	<li>Fix the about page</li>
      <li>Strip out all the old content</li>
	<li>Add some new content</li>
	<li>Decide that I really should use a better editor</li>
</ul>

But seriously, I had been looking for a way to get more comfortable with some new tech and needed to update my online presence anyway. And I am truly the hippest in a household of geeks.
